User experience

Flight Tracker is a live flight tracking web app that allows a user to view flights in real time imposed onto a Google map. The direction of the aircraft is demonstrated by the direction of the marker displayed. The location of the markers is updated every ten seconds to simulate a live radar situation.

A user is able to click on any marker and thereby retrieve more information about an aircraft. A bottom drawer will slide up to display this information and a thumbnail photo of the aircraft if available.

If the user is registered and logged in they will be able to click the "spotted" button in this component to save the selected aircraft to the database.

The user can then navigate to their profile page where a table containing a list of "spotted" flights is kept. The table holds information available for those flights such as model of aircraft, origin country, call sign, and a thumbnail photograph. There is a delete button next to the row of each entry that a user can use to remove an aircraft.
